CakeSpec unit tests are written for PHPUnit.  To determine if phpunit is install
simple run phpunit --help from the command line

To Install PHPUnit see: http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.6/en/installation.html

To run CakeSpec's unit tests simply issue the following command from the shell 
from the tests directory. PHPUnit will read the phpunit.xml and run all the 
tests.

    phpunit

If all tests pass you will see a green line of text something like ...
    
    OK (X tests, X assertions)
